#Before we go any further, letâ€™s talk a little bit about True and False. You may notice that when you type them in the code editor (with uppercase T and F), they appear in a different color than variables or strings. This is because True and False are their own special type: bool.

#True and False are the only bool types, and any variable that is assigned one of these values is called a boolean variable.

#Boolean variables can be created in several ways. The easiest way is to simply assign True or False to a variable:

#These are simple ways to assign True or False to a Boolean Variable
#set_to_true = True
#set_to_false = False
