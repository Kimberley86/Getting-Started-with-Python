#This is called a single-string
#print("Hello World")

#This is called a multi-string
#print("""I am Captain America.
#No I am Steve Rogers.
#No, I am Poppy.""")

#This is called a new line indicator character - puts each individual line on it's own line
#print("I am Captain America. \n")

#This is how to multiply a string of text - don't forget to add the new line indicator for each line
print("I am Captain America \n" * 5)
