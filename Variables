#This section is where we are learning to code with variables

#print("Hello, welcome to NetworkChuck Coffee!!!")

#name = input("What is your name?\n")

#A variable is a method of storing data for future use
#print("Hello " + name + ", thank you so much for coming in today.\n\n\n")

#This is how to code a variable - name is equal to the variable and string
#We then printed the name of the variable, which in this case is my name
#name = "Kimberley"
#print(name)

#Let's get the robot to ask questions with a menu variable
#menu = "Black Coffee, Espresso, Latte, Cappucino"

#print(name + ", what would you like from our menu today? Here is what we are serving.\n" + menu)

#This is the customer's input variable
#order = input()

#Sounds good Joshua, we'll have that Latte ready for you in a moment
#print("Sounds good " + name + ", we'll have that " + order + " ready for you in a moment.")
